      <p> Growing up I was always the silly type. I laughed and found humor in everything I could because most times when I would leave the house I would have to be serious. My dad is a executive chef, real estate investor, prime family member, and my mom is a doctor who was one of the few of my grandmothers 15 children to do something with her life even with her uprbringing, so I was always seen to be the golden goose since even before I was born.
   I was always expected to do great things so to avoid dissapointment I did, I do. And with that pressure of success, though it can be daugnting, I use it as fuel instead of weight on my shoulders. I excelled in my acedemics but would sometimes end up in troublesome perdicements at home becuase I would be so eager to something other than be serious all the time and because of the trouble, there was a period where I stopped. My sun stopped shining and I would only center my life on doing my work so that I could grow up faster and be able to live my own life outside of my parents shadow without dissapointing them or my other family members. For years I wouldnt say anything outside of limited responces or show any emtion becuase at the time I didnt feel like I had any. Always working towards a bigger goal not allowing any outside nonsence to interfear which eventually made everything boring to me which to this day still has effect. I could be at a family event, play space, vacation, and the whole time I would be bored. Empty. </p>

    <p> I dont know when, how, or even if I ever got completely out of that habit but I do know that it happened sometime during quarentine when I grew a little lax on my acedemics and found more hobbies to do in order to entertain myself so that I didnt sink into a total pit of darkness. During that time it have me time to grow mentally and physically which then enticed my curiousity on how other things grew during that 2+ year period. To see my friends change and family develop it grew an interest in myself to where my biggest wonder was how I personally would or could develop. I then grew to do things that Id never do years proior like volenteer to go to my dads work places or ask to go visit aunts and cousins. I even picked up a hobbie that I swore to never do just to see how id develop from it which has turned out amazing. I have amazed myself and I assume my peers too but ive adapted the thought of, </p>
    <p> So what if they dont.</p>

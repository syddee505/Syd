    <p> I was born in Connecticut but I frequently travel down south with my dad to vistit family. While down there I visit local tourist attractions like the state farm arena, the Georgia aquarium, ITS SUGAR, and things of that nature. I love traveling and learning to adapt to my new enviornments, mainly becuase in adaption you get to learn about whats around you and learn how to safely maneuveur around your new setting.The feeling of adventuring though sometimes scary is actually thrilling and fulfils a pit of curiosity for me, I love taking opportunities that im interested in. </p>
